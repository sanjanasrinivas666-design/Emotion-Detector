# Emotion-Detector
Detects the emotions of the human emotional status by analyzing verbal, physical, and physiological signals using artificial intelligence
# Emotion Detection using RoBERTa

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting emotions from text using a deep learning model.
We used the RoBERTa transformer model to perform multi-label classification, meaning a single sentence can have multiple emotions.

The model is trained on a subset of the GoEmotions dataset and can take real-time user input to predict emotions.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```
pip install pandas numpy torch transformers scikit-learn
```

2. Run the script:

```
python main.py
```

3. After training, enter input:

```
Enter text: I am feeling really excited today
```

4. The model will output predicted emotions.
